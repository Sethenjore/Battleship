# Battleship
A JavaScript Battleship game

I learned how to make this game using the Head First JavaScript Programming book. In the book, they had the reader design a text-input form with a button click to submit. I wanted to intigrate an on click method of user input, along with some CSS to give the user feedback with some visual effect. Feel free to expand on it, I plan on adding a feature to allow the user to place battleships on their own grid sometime in the near future as I expand my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. You can contact me at sethenjore@gmail.com for criticisms, suggestions or questions.
