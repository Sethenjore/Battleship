# Battleship
A JavaScript Battleship game

I learned how to make this game using the Head First JavaScript Programming book. In the book, they had the reader design a text-input form with a button click to submit. I wanted to intigrate an on click method of user input, along with some CSS to give the user feedback with some visual effect. Feel free to expand on it. You can contact me at sethenjore@gmail.com
